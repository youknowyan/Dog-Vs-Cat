# Dog-Vs-Cat
This is the final individual project of Udacity Nanodegree: Machine Learning Engineer(Advanced). The name of this project is “Cat Vs dog” and its goal is to use deep learning (Convolutional Neural Network) to build and optimize a prediction model which can identify if a photo is about dogs or cats.
